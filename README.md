What is a "discord token"?

A token is string based on multiple properties of an account used by discord in order to authorize a specific user. This string however can be used as a key to directly access a discord users account where a malicious hacker may steal sensitive information such as emails, phone numbers, billing information, and more.

Due to this access, many malicious programs and methods have sprung up in order to automate the proccess of stealing. These programs are prevelant on github and are also promoteed through the use of "mass dming", where by many botted discord accounts will directly message all users in a server to join their guild or run their program. This programs were also embeded into tools that users would run without knowing malware was inside

As these programs evolved, they became much more advanced, and were useful for more than just discord tokens. Some of these stealers developed password and cookie stealing from popular browsers, Crypto wallet stealers for popular crypto wallets like Exodus and Metamask. 

Some common features of the more advanced grabbers are listed below:
- Discord token
- Discord password
- Discord email
- Badges
- Autmatically purchase nitro for self
- Credit card info (number, expiry date, cvv)
- Internet IP
- Browser passwords and cookies (chromium usually)
- Cryptocurrency wallets (Exodus, Metamask, etc.)
- No ativirus detections on popular AV's (Windows Defender, etc.)

### "You've been exposed in this server" scam
In this scam someone sends you a message along the lines of "You have been exposed join this discord". Upon joining a bot will ask you to scan a QR code for verification. This QR code however grant the owner of the code direct access to your account if scanned by the phone of the account holder. This is an exploit in the relatively recent update to discord allowing your logged in phone to grant any desktop instant access to your discord account through a QR code. There is a warning in the app to be careful though this hasnt been enough for some people. Obviously your photos have not been leaked and the ultimate goal of the scammer is to get access to your account. This method exploits the self-consciousness and fear of the victim and does not even require any outside program.
