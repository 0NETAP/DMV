## ðŸ’¬ Information
You may ask why do they steal cookies? Well they use cookies to login to your Email, Bank, Roblox ect. This is how they fully take over your account(s). You may also ask why do they need to know what type of badges my discord account has? Well this is because accounts with "Rare" badges sell for a high price on the market. 

These "Rare" badges are   

    Early Supporter, 
    Early Developer, 
    HypeSquad Events, 
    Bug Hunter, 
    Partnered Server Owner, 
    3+ month boost badges. 

These all sell for big $ on the market hence are targeted more.

Also keep in mind you can get scammed not only by running a program but by scanning a QR-code like "FREE NITRO"

## ðŸ›‘ Signs of a scam

* Someone out of the blue messages and asks you to test their game for a school project, or to be a beta tester

* Someone sends you a message along the lines of "You have been exposed join this discord" then you join and there is a bot asking you to scan a QR code for verification

If you have seen these scenarios it was 100% a scam. 

Keep in mind you could recive this message from anyone your friend, IRL friend, ect. This is because there account has been compromised and it automatically sends messages to people on the friends list who have the persons **trust.**
